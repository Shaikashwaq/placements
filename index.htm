          <b> There were 3 programming problems to solve in Java only. You cannot use any other language strictly. EPAM
            is primarily product-based, they develop and excel in Java. However, this doesn’t imply that if you’re a
            Python expert, there are no opportunities. According to the orientation, they selected Java as because that
            is what they use primarily, and also, this is the most common language which is part of the academic
            syllabus in every college throughout India. Also, you need to have a working webcam which will be on
            throughout the exam. Leaving your chair, going somewhere else, anyone else appearing the camera, covering
            the camera, etc. is strictly prohibited and will give you warnings 1-2 times before canceling your exam.
            Don’t cheat! However, you can have water or stuff, given you don’t leave your seat. So sit prepared with pen
            paper bottle etc. whichever you need. Needless to say, no mobile phones are allowed. They’ll check your
            footage randomly later, so even if you do, you’ll lose then. Also, there is plagiarism checking, copying is
            also not allowed. Also, you cannot switch windows or open new tabs or you’ll be warned and your examination
            is liable to be canceled.

Mostly based on arrays, linklists, stacks, queues, etc. But the question had a high chance of getting a time limit error. The constraint was on the level of 10^9 to 10^16.
